# About me

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Dimitar Raychev, a JavaScript student at SoftUni, with a burning passion for coding. I currently work as an IT Technical Support Agent, but my journey in the tech world started as an IT Infrastructure Installation and Support Specialist and Computer Systems Technician. In addition to my professional experiences, I have a deep-seated interest in blockchain, web3, and trading.
